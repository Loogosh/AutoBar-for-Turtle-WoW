# AutoBar-for-Turtle-WoW
AutoBar updated to work with Turtle WoW (specifically Goblins and High Elves), as well as new (currently probably incomplete) groups for items that start quests and items used during quests.

# Known Issues:
- I almost certainly did not find all the quest items yet.
- Translation files were not updated.
- All Turtle WoW specific mounts were not updated.  I'm not going to fix this as in less than a week we'll have the mount journal anyways.

# Changelog

## Initial Upload: 
- Goblins/High Elves no longer have an error shot at them and will be able to use autobar correctly. 
- Added category QuestStartItems and populated with 211 items that start quests.  
- Added category QuestUseItems and populated it with 92 items used during quests.  
- Added Goblin and High Elf starting food and water to correct categories.  
- Added Crystal-Infused Bandage to Bandages even though I'm not sure this isn't just a database error.
